# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In this project, we were tasked with finding a way to create a piece of looping code that would search through a large data set with a list  of stock tickers and their respective starting and closing prices for 2 different years: 2017 and 2018. While we could have used cell formulas to accomplish this, we wanted to make a tool that would allow for more data to be added to the original sheets and make sure that our processes still worked no matter how much data was added. Throughout the course of the project, we built on to our VBA code so that it became more efficient, comprehensive, and readable. Using For loops, we were able to have our code pull from the relevant rows of data for each ticker and then display the total grossed amount and also the return on investment for either year. From there, we refactored our code to make it run more efficiently so that when we add more data to the set, it will continue to run smoothly and without issue.
